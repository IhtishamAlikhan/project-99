# Project-99
Project 99 is a straightforward WordPress plugin designed to enable users to express their preference for or against any post on a website, appearing specifically on individual blog posts.

Inspired by the familiar functionality on Facebook, where users can like or dislike posts with their reactions being counted, this plugin brings a similar feature to any website. Users can easily like or dislike posts.
